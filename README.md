# Introduction to Ramsey Theory Results

This project aims to provide an introduction to Ramsey theory, including classic theorems, suitable proofs, and explicit examples where possible. In addition, we will extend our discussion to hypergraphs.

## Overview

Ramsey theory is the study of conditions under which order must appear in some structure. In particular, it seeks to find the minimum number of elements required such that a particular structure will appear. The field has applications in computer science, graph theory, and combinatorics.

## Classic Theorems

We will cover several classic theorems in Ramsey theory, including:

- Ramsey's theorem
- Van der Waerden's theorem

## Proofs and Examples

We will provide suitable proofs for each of the theorems mentioned above and provide explicit examples where possible to aid in understanding.

## Extension to Hypergraphs

In addition to discussing traditional Ramsey theory, we will also extend our discussion to hypergraphs. This will involve exploring various hypergraph extensions of the classic theorems and discussing their applications.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, readers should have a solid understanding of Ramsey theory and its applications, including the classic theorems and their proofs, explicit examples, and hypergraph extensions.
